This folder contains the R script to produce the PGLS analysis that look at the correlation between genomic diversity values (*H* and *N<sub>e</sub>*) and conservation status or
available present and past area.

The script also include the production of the Figure3 and Figure4. 

In the folder are also present example files (**or the original files**) that are necessary for the analysis.

The files are:

Species.txt -> A list with the species name under exame in a single column with no header \
Enm_areas.csv -> This file will be produced in the first step of the PGLS_setup.R script. It contains the suitable area (>0.36) of each period under exams. \
Species_Ne.xlsx -> an excel file containing the mean **N<sub>e/<sub>* estimation and Variance for each species
