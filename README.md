# Demographic dynamics in tortoises and freshwater turtles

This repository contains scripts for a study on the past demographic history and past available climatic niche for 22 species of tortoises and terrapins

All data analysis were performed on the only server Galaxy Europe (https://usegalaxy.eu/) that is a web-based platform for accessible, reproducible, and transparent computational research that doesnâ€™t require programming. So no script for data analysis are here reported.  For information on how to perform the analysis (software and option used) please refer to materials and methods of the manuscript.

This repository is organised in folders divided by main analysis. In each folder is present a README file with information regarding the usage of the script
