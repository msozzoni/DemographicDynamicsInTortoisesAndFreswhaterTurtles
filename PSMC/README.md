This folder contains the R script to produce every PSMC image of the manuscript. 

This scripts PSMC_complete_setup.R and PSMC_complete_run.R are used to produce Figure 1 and Figure S5-S22 \
meanwhile, the script General_demo_trend.R is used to produce the Figure 2.

The species.tar.gz file used in the scripts PSMC_complete_setup.R and PSMC_complete_run.R is a zipped folder with all the 30 runs of psmc for each species  \
(e.g. Emys_orbicularis.tar.gz has the 30 psmc run only for *Emys orbicularis*) 

The file T_data.xlsx contains the Surface mean temperature from Hansen et al. (2013) (http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsta.2012.0294)

The file species.0.txt used in the script General_demo_trend.R represent one run (the first) of the psmc for each species \
(e.g. Apalone_spinifera.0.txt represent the first run of the species *Apalone spinifera*)
